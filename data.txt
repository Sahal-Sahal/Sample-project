Samsung Galaxy S23 FE is reportedly in the works and could be launched soon. 
A company executive recently hinted at the imminent debut of the smartphone during the recently concluded Galaxy Unpacked event in Seoul.
 While the launch date and other details are yet to be announced by the firm, the phone's expected specifications and design have already been 
leaked on several occasions and a new report claims it will feature an upgraded selfie camera.
 The Galaxy S23 FE was previously tipped to sport a triple rear camera unit led by a 50-megapixel primary sensor.
 It is expected to succeed the Galaxy S21 FE that was launched last year.
